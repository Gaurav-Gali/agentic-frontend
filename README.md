> Flow-based backend creation and orchestration platform

Build, visualize, and run backend flows composed of modular nodes. Each node exposes its logic as an API, enabling dynamic execution of flows via HTTP endpoints. Perfect for quickly creating data pipelines, custom backends, and dynamic UIs without writing repetitive boilerplate.

## Features

- Visual flow editor with nodes & edges
- Node APIs for modular execution
- Flow endpoints for project-based orchestration
- Supports DB queries, transformations, API calls, and more
- Easy extension with custom node types
- CLI tool to generate dynamic UIs from endpoints
